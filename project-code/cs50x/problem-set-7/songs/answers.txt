To determine the listener's audio aura from their top 100 songs in 2018, we can focus on three key musical attributes:

1. The intensity and liveliness of a song. High energy indicates more active and dynamic tracks.
2. The musical positivity of a track, with higher values indicating happier and more upbeat songs.
3. How suitable a track is for dancing, considering factors like rhythm and tempo.

To describe the listener's audio aura, we can calculate the average values of these attributes across their top 100 songs.

SQL Query to Calculate Average Audio Features

```sql
SELECT AVG(energy) AS avg_energy, AVG(valence) AS avg_valence, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM songs;
```

This query provides the average energy, valence, and danceability, offering a summary of the listener's musical tastes and preferences.

Reflections on the Calculation's Representativeness

While calculating average energy, valence, and danceability gives an overview of the listener's musical preferences, it may not fully capture the complexity of their audio aura. Some potential shortcomings maybe:

1. Lack of Diversity Representation
2. Influence of Outliers
3. Temporal Dynamics

Suggestions for Improved Calculation

1. Instead of using overall averages, analyze the data by segmenting songs into different clusters based on similar characteristics.
2. If available, use play counts to weight the importance of each song.
3. Incorporate sentiment analysis of lyrics to complement the audio feature data.

By adopting these methods, we can gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of a listener's musical landscape, reflecting both the diversity and emotional depth of their listening habits.
