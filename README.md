This is my journey through CS50.

In order of which attemted:

> CS50AI - CS50's Introdution to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other topics in artificial intelligence as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By course’s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

> CS50PY - CS50's Introdution to Programming with Python

CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python is an introductory course offered by Harvard University through its online platform, edX. It's part of the larger CS50 curriculum, which covers various aspects of computer science. This particular course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of programming using Python, one of the most popular and versatile programming languages today.

> CS50X - CS50's Introdution to Computer Science

This is CS50, Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. This course teaches how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which we learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that we understand all the more because of C. Toward the end, the course introduces SQL, via which we store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which we create web and mobile apps alike.
